 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Imran's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I started my coding journey as a naive computer science student with a passion to learn everything I could about this programming world - code, Unix, Linux, Networks and theory. And all the while, teaching myself android development with a dream to build my app, but that soon got overshadowed by my desire to excel in Computer Networking. After learning a lot about the networks I jumped towards ethical hacking and learned a lot of hacking techniques. After spending some time learning hacking I noticed that I enjoy more while building new things and then I took a deep dive into software development, Learned how web apps work, learned different frameworks, and software design patterns. Then I started working at a database company building database solution, so I started learning database internals and started contributing to postgres based opensource solutions.
